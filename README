View mapzen tiles using threejs and AWS server
To view tiles, ssh into EC2 at desired zoom level
  To determine the EC2 machine, examine initiateWebSockets in Utilities.js
    This function creates a hashtable mapping zoom level to EC2 IP address, so just find the EC2 machine with IP corresponding to desired zoom
After ssh, run command:
  java -jar myserver.jar <port> <zoom> <numberWorkerThreads> <prefetchingRadius> <displayRadius>
  The port should be 3000 + zoom (for example, zoom level 10 would be on port 3010)
Example command:
  java -jar myserver.jar 3010 10 4 8 3
    Starts zoom level 10 server with 4 worker threads, a prefetching radius of 8, and a display radius of 3
Once server is running, open index.html and choose starting destination
  Format for starting destination: latitude,longitude,zoom,filetype,size
  Example: 36.056595,-112.125092,10,terrarium,256   <--   View Grand Canyon at zoom 10
  Currently terrarium is only supported filetype
  Size can be 256 or 512
Please stop any running EC2 machines when finished!
