Within Prefetch Test
    1.) Create requests and place them in a list.
        i.) Create a request for the center tile with isCenter set to true.
        ii.) Create requests for the neighbors of the center tile with isCenter set to false.
                The neighbors consist of tiles that are within the view radius in all directions.
    2.) Assign those requests to the appropriate zoom in this case zoom 10
    3.) Begin the sending sequence
        i.) Send the first request
        ii.) If the message is decoded send the next message given the request queue is not empty
        iii.) If the request queue is empty the zoom will set a flag that it has finished its task

Outside Prefetch Test
    1.) Create requests and place them in a list.
        i.) Create a request for the center tile with isCenter set to true.
        ii.) Subsequent requests are made for tiles that are (r+2) tiles away from the current center in the positive
                x and y directions.
    2.) Assign those requests to the appropriate zoom in this case zoom 10
    3.) Begin the sending sequence
        i.) Send the first request
        ii.) If the message is decoded send the next message given the request queue is not empty

Multiple clients are tested by running the above tests within there own threads for each client and compiling the results
after their termination.
